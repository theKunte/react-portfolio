          <strong>Hi! I'm Jenny</strong> ‚Äî a former project auditor turned
          software engineer with a deep love for crafting solutions that matter.
          My path into tech wasn‚Äôt linear, and that‚Äôs what makes it powerful.
        </p>

        <p>
          I began in corporate project auditing, where precision, communication,
          and structure were everything. At the same time, I started my journey
          of becoming a software engineer for something more creative and
          impactful. I started learning application development at NSC.
        </p>

        <p>
          Fast forward to today ‚Äî I hold a BA in Application Development and
          spend my days turning ideas into functional, elegant software. I
          specialize in writing clean code, building intuitive UIs, and
          collaborating with teams to bring digital products to life.
        </p>

        <p>
          Whether I‚Äôm contributing to a frontend feature, optimizing backend
          logic, or tinkering with animations (like this cup of coffee üçµ), I
          bring passion, persistence, and a detail-oriented mindset to
          everything I do.
        </p>

        <p>
          Outside of code, I‚Äôm an adventure hiker, avid baker, world traveler,
          and amateur photographer. These experiences help fuel my creativity
          and balance.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>
            I‚Äôm always excited to meet new collaborators or take on challenges.
          </strong>
          Where technology makes life better. Let‚Äôs connect ‚Äî I‚Äôd love to hear
          your story too.
        </p>
